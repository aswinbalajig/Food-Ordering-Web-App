The project revolves around the development of an online food ordering web application 
designed to offer users a seamless and efficient platform for ordering food . Built with a focus on 
user-friendliness and functionality, the application utilizes Bootstrap for the frontend, ensuring a responsive and visually engaging interface across different devices and screen sizes. 
Complementing this, the backend is powered by ASP.NET, providing scalability and robustness in 
handling user requests and data management tasks. The database management aspect is handled 
by SQL, facilitating efficient storage and retrieval of crucial user, order, and menu data.

The application incorporates several key features to enhance the user experience and streamline 
the ordering process. 

The home page serves as a central hub, offering essential website information and user reviews to build trust and credibility. Navigation buttons enable seamless transitions between different sections such as the menu and contact pages. On the menu page, users can easily browse through various food options, filter them by categories, and view comprehensive product 
listings, including images, names, and prices. 

Adding items to the cart is intuitive, allowing users 
to compile their orders effortlessly. The cart facility enables users to manage their selected items efficiently, while user account management functionalities streamline the account creation, login, and profile management 
processes. 

Users can view and update their personal information and access their purchase history 
to track previous orders. Furthermore, the application includes a contact page for users to submit feedback, fostering communication between customers and the platform administrators. 

The admin panel offers various management capabilities, allowing administrators to add or remove products and categories, manage stock levels, and toggle product visibility. Importantly, the admin panel features sentiment analysis functionality, enabling administrators to assess the positivity of customer feedback. 

This analysis generates graphical representations of categorical sentiment analysis, providing insights into the sentiment distribution across different categories of feedback. 

Additionally, annual sentiment score analysis offers a comprehensive view of overall sentiment trends over time, empowering administrators to identify areas for improvement and enhance the platform's service quality and customer satisfaction continuously.
